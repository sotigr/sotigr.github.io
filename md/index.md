# Welcome to my little site

In here I store notes, articles and guides of my various hobbies, but mostly coding, computer tinkering and 3D printing 
 
If you like this website's implementation, you can find the source [here](https://github.com/sotigr/sotigr.github.io). It uses mkdocs with the material theme plugin and they are both awesome tools.
